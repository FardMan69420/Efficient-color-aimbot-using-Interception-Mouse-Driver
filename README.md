# Efficient color aimbot, using Interception mouse driver & AutoItX3
First off. If you are a skidd, u should find something easier to work with.  <br />

# What is api interception? when is it used? how to implement it in C#

API interception is intercepting calls to a given DLL and re-directing them through your code.  <br />

It is generally used to override some functionality provided by a DLL. An example is for adding a logo to a DirectX based game.  <br />

How to implement it? Thats a complicated one and it depends on what sort of DLL you are trying to intercept. You may want do look around here and the net about "DLL Injection" or "API hooking".  <br />

# Interceptor

Interceptor is a wrapper for a Windows keyboard driver (Wrapping http://oblita.com/Interception).  <br />

# How to use (Implement it in your C# Project)  <br />

# Why Interception & AutoItX3 instead of a normal / basic PixelSearch Color Aimbot?

Altough this Color Aimbot it's basic, it can bypass / bypassed most known Kernel-Level Anti Cheats. (Used to bypass Vanguard, it can still bypass it with a more advanced color aimbot or sm.)  <br />

Any AHK Script / Basic Color/Pixel Based Aimbot it's detected / just doesen't work on games like Valorant because of the new mouse bypass for Valorant, they are currently checking for LLMHF_INJECTED.  <br />

You can use an older version of "rawaccel" instead of Interception it might bypass the ac.  <br />

# AutoItX3

AutoIt v3 is a freeware BASIC-like scripting language designed for automating the Windows GUI and general scripting.  <br />

* I used it for PixelSearch, PixelCoords *   <br />
